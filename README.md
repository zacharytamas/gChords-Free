This is a guitar chord dictionary I wrote for the 
first version of Palm's webOS. I was one of the 
initial developers to release apps for the platform. 
I built this over a weekend to test the waters of 
the new platform. The application has had over 
70,000 downloads. I intended to revisit it with a 
paid version with more features but other 
ventures were higher priority.
