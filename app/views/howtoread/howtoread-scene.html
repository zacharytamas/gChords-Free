    <div class="title">What is a chord chart?</div>
	<div class="palm-body-text">
	    The ability to read a chord chart is a very important skill for every
	    guitarist to know. A chord chart, as are generated by this app, is a 
	    graphical representation of how to form a chord on the guitar neck. This
	    article will serve as a primer for how to read any chord chart you come
	    across.
	</div>
	
	<div class="title">Frets and Strings</div>
	<div class="palm-body-text">
	   The horizontal lines on a chord chart represent the fret wire on the guitar
	   neck, dividing the diagram into frets. Typically, the first fret from the
	   top is the first fret of the guitar, the second being the second, and so
	   on; however, on certain occasions where the chord shown is located farther
	   down the neck a fret number will be shown beside the first fret of the
	   diagram, and all positions shown should be played relative to that fret.
	</div>
	<div class="palm-body-text">
	   There are six vertical lines on a chord chart&mdash;each representing a
	   string of the guitar. From left to right they represent the 6th, 5th, 4th,
	   3rd, 2nd, and 1st strings of the guitar.
	</div>
	
	<div class="title">Reading Notes</div>
	<div class="palm-body-text">
	   A chord chart tells you exactly what to do on each string to form a chord.
	   If there is an X above the string on the chart you do not play that string.
	   An O above a line means you play that string open&mdash;play the string
	   without fretting a particular note. If a dot is shown on the string, 
	   pay attention to what fret the dot is shown in, and place a finger
	   accordingly on the guitar.
	</div>
	
	<div class="title">Barring</div>
	<div class="palm-body-text">
	   A common technique in guitar chord forming is the use a "bar" with one of 
	   your fingers. On some chord charts (gChords charts included) a bar is 
	   shown by a long line across several strings of a fret&mdash;representing
	   that you should press a finger down across all of those strings. For an 
	   example of a bar, see the F Major chord in the Chord Library.
	</div>
	
	<div class="title">Fingering</div>
	<div class="palm-body-text">
	   Many guitar chord charts, including gChords, show fingering suggestions
	   along with the chord diagram. In these cases, on top of the dots on the
	   chart, a number is placed, telling you which finger you should use to
	   press that string. Keep in mind these are suggestions: feel free to use
	   whichever fingers work best for you.
